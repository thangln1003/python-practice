# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard)
# https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/

# There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
# Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
# You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

# nums1 = [1, 3]
# nums2 = [2]
# The median is 2.0

# nums1 = [1, 2]
# nums2 = [3, 4]
# The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

# TODO: Approach 1: Recursive Approach

class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArray(self, nums1: List[int], num2: List[int]) -> float:
        return 0
